## Introduction
Internet has been widely used among people, while the pornography, violent and terrorist pictures may also be accessed as well, which do harm to people's mental health.

In order to solve this problem, we train deep convolutional neural networks(DCNN) based on a bunch of training image data to server as **Image Guarder**.

Our algorithm achieves the accuracy of **78%** and the performance can be improved with more training data.
