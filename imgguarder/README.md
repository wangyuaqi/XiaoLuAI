# Image Guarder

## Introduction
Internet has been widely used among people, while the pornography, violent and terrorist pictures may also be accessed, which do harm to people's mental health.

In order to solve this problem, we train a deep convolutional neural networks(DCNN) based on a bunch of training image data to server as **Image Guarder**.

Our algorithm reaches the accuracy of **92.11%** and the performance can be improved with more training data.
