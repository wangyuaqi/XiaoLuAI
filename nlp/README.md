# Natural Language Process Module

## Introduction
This module is designed for NLP task, it includes several NLP tasks:
* [Text Classification](text_classifier.py)

## Corpora
In order to make use of NLP module, you'd better download the corpora data firstly. The following corpora data is recommended:
* [Fudan NLP Text Corpora](https://share.weiyun.com/67ac1ff60864c564a86181e5e84cd2e4)

## Performance
This unoptimized code reaches accuracy **82.09184%** by [Decision Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree) with the feature vector dimension of **2000** on 
[Fudan NLP Text Corpora BEnchmark](https://share.weiyun.com/67ac1ff60864c564a86181e5e84cd2e4) which contains **20** classes. We believe it'll be much improved 
when precisely picked [user dict](./user_dict.txt) and [stopwords](./stopwords.txt) are given.
